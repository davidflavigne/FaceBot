FaceBot Facebook bot
====================
	
Less-than-minimalist python implementation of a Facebook Bot based on the work of [hikaruAi](https://github.com/hikaruAi/),
using [Selenium Webdriver](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/) and [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/). Coded
during the Coding Academy formation.

FaceBot allows you to connect to your facebook account and do several actions on it:
+ Get notifications
+ Send a message to a friend
+ Get list of friends
+ Send several messages in a row to the last conversation
